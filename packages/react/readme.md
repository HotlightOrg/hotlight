# Hotlight React

Enable your users to quickly find what they are looking for and perform actions from a command palette in your app or on your website. Hotlight is like Alfred / Quicksilver / Spotlight, but for the web. It is open source and comes with support for multiple frameworks.

Hotlight is based on web components, loaded lazily and available in `React` through this package.

Install it through `npm`:

```bash
npm install hotlight-react
```

or `yarn`:

```bash
yarn install hotlight-react
```
