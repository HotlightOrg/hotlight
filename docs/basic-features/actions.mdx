# Actions

The hits that appears in Hotlight when you search are called actions. They are central to the way Hotlight is being used.

`Actions` adhere from one or multiple `sources`, where you can create actions dynamically when needed.

```ts
import { hotlight } from "hotlight-core";
const hl = hotlight();

const actions = [{
  title: "All products",
  trigger: "/"
},{
  title: "Dark mode",
  trigger: () => {
    darkMode(); // this would be defined by you
  }
},{
  title: "Mark done",
  trigger: async () => {
    const todoId = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).id;
    done(todoId);
  }
}];

const sources = {
  actions: [{
    title: "All products",
    trigger: "/",
  }]
}

hl.configure({
  sources
});
```

Actions can also be defined ad hoc, using a callback function that returns an array of actions.

```ts
const sources = {

```

```ts
interface ActionBase {
  title: string; // this appears in each hit in the result list
  alias?: string; // aliases are matched as well
  trigger: Trigger; // the trigger is what is called when you press enter or click on the result
}
```

```ts


```
