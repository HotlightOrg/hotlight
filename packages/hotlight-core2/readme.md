# Hotlight Core

As Hotlight aims to support the most popular web frameworks, the core of it is written in plain web components.

This allows for thin client side wrappers in other frameworks and libs, enabling easy integration.

The configuration works the same way, no matter what framework it is integrated in, and as long as the `DOM` (`jsdom`) is present, hotlight will work the same way.

## Goals for Hotlight Core

- Lightweight, without dependencies,
- Convension over configuration
- Fast, smooth UX
- Customizable UI
